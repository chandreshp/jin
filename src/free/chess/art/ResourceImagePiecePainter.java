   * ResourceImagePiecePainter will try to read a file named "sizes.txt" from
   * the relative path. That file should contain two lines. The first line
   * must contain a single integer specifying the preferred size. The 2nd line
   * should contain a list of sizes of all the available piece images, separated
   * by spaces. It will then look for directories with names corresponding to 
   * the sizes and in those directories for resources named
   * "<color char><piece char>.<extension>" where <color char> is either
   * 'w' or 'b' (for black or white), <piece char> is one of 'k', 'q', 'r', 'b'
   * 'n' or 'p'. The images for all twelve pieces must be present there and they
   * must have the correct size.
   * <P>For example,
   * <code>new ResourceImagePiecePainter(com.mycompany.Myclass.class, "marble", "gif")</code>
   * will create a ResourceImagePiecePainter which will load "sizes.txt" from
   * com/mycompany/marble/sizes.txt and will then proceed loading images from
   * (for example) com/mycompany/marble/32/wb.gif, com/mycompany/marble/32/br.gif,
