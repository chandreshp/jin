conditionHelpDialog.message = \
  \  The condition specifies in which cases the game will be logged. The condition\n\
  must be a valid Java boolean expression. While it may sound a bit scary at\n\
  first, it is really quite easy - all you have to do is write down a list of\n\
  simple conditions, such as "rating > 2000" or "time > 15", surround them with\n\
  brackets and then connect them with either "&&" or "||" strings, where "&&"\n\
  stands for "and" and "||" stands for "or".\n\
\n\
\n\
  Here are some examples so you see how easy it is:\n\
\n\
  "(inc == 0) || (time > 15)"\n\
  \  Means that the increment of the game must be 0 or the time more than 15 (or\n\
  \  both - "or" in computer languages means that both conditions can be true too).\n\
\n\
  "(rating < 1800) && (etime >= 10)"\n\
  \  Means that the opponent's rating must be less than 1800 and the etime of the\n\
  \  game (the time plus 2/3 of the increment) must be more than or equal to 10.\n\
\n\
  "((result == "loss") || (moves > 20)) && rated"\n\
  \  Means that the game must be rated and the result is a loss (for you, the user)\n\
  \  and/or more than 20 moves must have been made in the game.\n\
\n\
\n\
  Important things to remember:\n\
\n\
  * "||", the "or" sign works even when *both* of the expressions to its right and\n\
  \  its left are true. It is usually referred to as "and/or", by people other than\n\
  \  mathematicians and computer scientists.\n\
\n\
  * Remember to use "==" for an equal sign, and not "=", because "=" in Java\n\
  \  stands for assignment, not equality, so "rating = 2000", for example,\n\
  \  assigns the variable "rating" the value 2000, instead of checking whether the\n\
  \  rating is 2000).\n\
\n\
  * All string comparisons ("opponent == "AlexTheGreat"" for example) are case\n\
  \  sensitive. If you want to compare strings case insensitively, do it like so:\n\
  \  "opponent.equalsIgnoreCase("AlexTheGreat")" (of course the string\n\
  \  "equalsIgnoreCase" itself is case sensitive).\n\
\n\
  * If you want to check that a certain string contains another string (for\n\
  \  example you want to know if your opponent's titles include the string "GM"),\n\
  \  you do it like so:\n\
  \  "titles.indexOf("GM") != -1"\n\
  \  Here, too, the comparison is case sensitive.\n\
\n\
  * It's best not to compare fractions with the equality ("==") sign, but instead\n\
  \  to use "<", ">", "<=" or ">=".\n\
\n\
  * All the examples in this help file are surrounded with double quotes - the\n\
  \  actual conditions should not be surrounded with them.\n\
\n\
\n\
  \  If you're still feeling stumped, I suggest you either use the "Log all games"\n\
  option and later choose yourself which games you want to keep or ask for help at\n\
  the appropriate room/channel on the server.\n\

  \              | currently only chess (non wild)     | "1-minute" (for ICC),\n\
  \              | games can be logged. Remember that  | "lightning", "blitz",\n\
  \              | this is case sensitive              | "standard" (for FICS).\n\
   --------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------\n\
   rating        | The opponent's rating.              | 2000, 1600, 0\n\
