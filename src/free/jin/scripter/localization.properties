beanshellHelpDialog.message = \
  \  BeanShell is a Java source interpreter, meaning that beanshell scripts are\n\
  essentially pieces of Java code. BeanShell, however, also has scripting features\n\
  which extend (or break, depends on how you feel) the Java language. This means,\n\
  for example, that you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you use\n\
  it. You can also hold different types of objects in the same variable at\n\
  different times. You can find a complete description of the BeanShell language\n\
  at http://www.beanshell.org/docs.html.\n\
  \n\
  \  Your code doesn't start running in a blank environment - you already have a\n\
  bunch of useful variables and methods defined which you can use. The most useful\n\
  is the sendCommand(String) method which simply sends the specified string to the\n\
  server. You can also use various variables whose exact identity and values are\n\
  determined by the type and subtype of the event that your script is running on.\n\
  A list of the "built-in" methods and variables is available at\n\
  http://www.jinchess.com/docs/scripter/\n\
  \n\
  \  An interesting property of how your BeanShell scripts are executed is that\n\
  they are stateful - they keep their state between separate runs of the same\n\
  script. Let's look at the following user invoked script, for example:\n\
  \n\
  if (start)\n\
  \  var = 0;\n\
  else\n\
  \  var++;\n\
  \n\
  sendCommand("tell fishbait " + var);\n\
  \n\
  \  When you first run it, you can pass true as the value for start and false on\n\
  consecutive executions. Each time you execute it, the value of var will be\n\
  increased and fishbait will receive tells with "0", "1", "2" etc. (which might\n\
  annoy him quite a bit, so I recommend trying it on yourself instead ;-)).

commandsConditionHelpDialog.title = Commands condition help
commandsConditionHelpDialog.message = \
  \  The condition allows you to specify your own custom filter (on top of the\n\
  event type and subtype selections) which determines when your script is run.\n\
  When an event of the chosen type and one of the chosen subtypes occurs, it will\n\
  be subjected to filtering by the condition you specify. If it passes that as\n\
  well, your script will be run.\n\
  \n\
  \  The condition must be a valid Java boolean expression. While it may sound a\n\
  bit scary at first, it is really quite easy - all you have to do is write down a\n\
  list of simple conditions, such as "oppRating > 2000" or\n\
  "gameResult.equals("win")", surround them with round brackets and then connect\n\
  them with either "&&" or "||" strings, where "&&" stands for "and" and "||"\n\
  stands for "or".\n\
  \n\
  \n\
  Here are some examples so you see how easy it is:\n\
  \n\
  "(myTime > 10) || (oppRating >= 1800)"\n\
  \  Means that you get 11 or more minutes on your clock or the opponent's rating\n\
  \  must be at least 1800 (or both - "or" in computer languages means at least one\n\
  \  of the conditions has to be true - if they are both true, then all the\n\
  \  better).\n\
  \n\
  "(sender.equals("AlexTheGreat")) && (message.equals("Hello"))"\n\
  \  Means that the sender must be AlexTheGreat and the message he sent must be\n\
  \  "Hello".\n\
  \n\
  "(oppRating > 2300) || (oppTitle.indexOf("GM") != -1)"\n\
  \  This is a slightly more complicated example. The first part of the condition\n\
  \  is easy - it means that the opponent's rating must be higher than 2300. The\n\
  \  second part uses the function "indexOf". That function looks for the specified\n\
  \  string ("GM" in our case) inside the string it was called on (oppTitle in our\n\
  \  case) and returns the index of its first appearance. More importantly, if it\n\
  \  doesn't find the string "GM" inside oppTitle (in our example), it will\n\
  \  return -1. Thus what we are checking with "oppTitle.indexOf("GM") != -1" is\n\
  \  basically that "GM" is a substring of the opponent's title, meaning that he is\n\
  \  a Grandmaster (On ICC and FICS, at least).\n\
  \  Finally, the two parts are connected with the "or" sign, meaning that the\n\
  \  whole expression will be true if at least one of the parts is true.\n\
  \n\
  IMPORTANT: The examples in this help file are surrounded with quotes - you do\n\
  NOT need to surround your condition in quotes when you write it.\n\
  \n\
  \  Note that if you don't specify a condition, a default condition which always\n\
  evaluates to true will be generated for you (meaning that the script will always\n\
  be run if an event of the proper type and subtype occurs).\n\
  \n\
  \  For a list and documentation of the variables (such as oppRating, myTime etc.)\n\
  you can use when writing scripts for various event types/subtypes, visit\n\
  http://www.jinchess.com/docs/scripter/.\n\
  \n\
  \  When you finish writing your script and click the "OK" button, Jin will try to\n\
  test your condition by evaluating it with dummy values for the variables to make\n\
  sure that it's valid. Since the variables it uses have dummy values, it may\n\
  sometimes tell you that the condition is malformed even though it is ok. This\n\
  should, however, happen very rarely, so make sure to check your condition again\n\
  before going ahead and telling Jin to use it anyway.

commandsCommandsHelpDialog.title = Commands help
commandsCommandsHelpDialog.message = \
  \  The commands are the "meat" of your script. You specify a single command on\n\
  each line. These will be sent to the server when the script is run, after some\n\
  processing. The processing allows you to add "variables" inside the commands\n\
  which are replaced with the "variable" values before the command is sent.\n\
  Those variables are specified by a dollar sign ('$') followed by the variable\n\
  name. The processing then looks for this pattern and replaces its occurances\n\
  with the value of the variable.\n\
  \n\
  \n\
  Let's look at some examples to get an idea of how it works:\n\
  \n\
  "tell Gorgonian Hello"\n\
  \  This will simply send the above command to the server.\n\
  \n\
  "tell $sender Hello"\n\
  \  Assuming that this script is responding to Chat Events (which provide a\n\
  \  "sender" variable) with the Personal Tell subtype enabled, and you received a\n\
  \  tell from Kiebitz, the command sent to the server will be "tell Kiebitz Hello"\n\
  \n\
  "tell $sender What do you mean by "$message"?"\n\
  \  This is a funny script I used to test the scripter. Basically this replies to\n\
  \  the sender asking him what he meant by his tell to you (or to a channel, or\n\
  \  shout, or any other Chat Event subtype you chose). The variable "message"\n\
  \  is replaced by the content of the sender's tell.\n\
  \n\
  "tell $who $what"\n\
  \  There are currently no "who" and "what" variables in any of the event types,\n\
  \  so what good is this script? It is good for User Invoked scripts! When you run\n\
  \  a User Invoked script, Jin will ask you to provide a list of variables and\n\
  \  their values, which it will then use to "process" the script. This allows you\n\
  \  to create "aliases" which you later run, although they are somewhat less\n\
  \  comfortable to use than real aliases.\n\
  \n\
  IMPORTANT: The examples in this help file are surrounded with quotes - you do\n\
  NOT need to surround your commands in quotes when you write them.\n\
  \n\
  Note that if you use a variable that isn't defined, it will not be replaced and\n\
  will be sent as specified, in its "$variable" form.\n\
  \n\
