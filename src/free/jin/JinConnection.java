/**
 * Defines the interface between the chess server and the client.
 * Some restrictions/rules on the implementation that can't be enforced by the compiler:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI> The implementation is responsible for firing events to registered listeners
 *        when needed. However, if a certain feature which is implied by
 *        calling the listener is not supported by the server, the implementation
 *        may ignore addListener and removeListener calls related to that feature
 *        or not fire events of that type.
 *   <LI> The calls to all the listeners must be done in the AWT event dispatching
 *        thread.
 *   <LI> The implementation is supposed to be completely self sufficient, meaning
 *        that only the methods specified in the interface are required to normally
 *        interact with it. For example, you can't require to call a special method
 *        to enable a certain feature - the implementation must decide by itself
 *        when to enable and when to disable the feature.
 *   <LI> The implementation must supress the textual message accompanying some event
 *        (sent by the server) when at least a single listener of that event is
 *        registered. On the other hand, the same textual message must NOT be
 *        supressed when there are no listeners registered.
 *   <LI> The implementation must be consistent in calling listeners. For example
 *        if a certain order of events is implied, the listeners must be called
 *        in that order - a MoveEvent must not be fired before a GameStartedEvent
 *        has been fired for that game or after a GameEndedEvent has been fired.
 *   <LI> If the server supports a certain feature only partially, the implementation
 *        is responsible for implementing the rest itself where possible
 *        and for providing default or blank values where impossible.
 * </UL>
 * Some assumptions the implementation is allowed to make:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI> Although it is not guaranteed that all calls to the Connection's methods
 *        will be done in any particular thread (including the AWT Event dispatching
 *        thread), the implementation may assume that all calls from user code
 *        will be sequential, i.e. no calls to any methods will be done by the 
 *        user code while one of the methods is executing from a thread other than
 *        the one executing that method.
 * </UL>
 *
 * The restrictions above are to be treated as assumptions for user code and the
 * assumptions above are to be treated as restrictions for user code. <P>
 *
 * If the server supports additional features beyond the specified in the
 * interface, it may add methods supporting these features. The server specific
 * user code, may then cast the implementation to its actual type and use
 * these methods. If certain features are supported in an extended form (more
 * information is sent by the server than is needed to support the interface),
 * the implementation may (but doesn't have to) fire subclasses of the appropriate
 * events (or return subclasses of objects in case of queries), adding the 
 * information sent by the server. The server specific user code handling the
 * event (or issuing the query), in turn, may (but again, does not have to)
 * cast the event (or returned object) to its actual type and retrieve the
 * extra information.
